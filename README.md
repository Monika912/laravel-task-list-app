Task List is a simple yet powerful Laravel application that allows users to manage their daily tasks. Users can add new tasks, edit existing tasks, mark tasks as completed or not completed, and delete tasks. The project demonstrates complete CRUD functionality while following Laravel best practices.
During this project, I learned and implemented several core Laravel concepts, including:

1. Routing for handling application URLs
2. Blade Templates & Directives for structuring views
3. Models and Migrations for database design
4. Model Factory & Seeder to generate sample data
5. Forms with CSRF Protection for secure input handling
6. Displaying of Flash Messages
7. Validation & Data Storage using Laravel’s built-in validators
8. TailwindCSS for fast and responsive UI styling
9. Alpine.js for lightweight interactivity on the frontend

This project strengthened my understanding of Laravel’s MVC architecture and helped me build a fully functional, clean, and user-friendly task management tool.
